# Zif
  
A Z-code engine for playing interactive fiction games.

Portability between different platforms, is a particular goal of Zif, and specifically
portability to the third generation Kindle, aka Kindle Keyboard. The Kindle keyboard
appears as an ideal platform for playing interactive fiction.

Zif includes an optional terminal emulator and a basic curses style front-end menu to
select story files. So when running on a Kindle, a third-party terminal emulator and
launcher is not necessary.

## How to run

Zif should be run from the directory where it was installed. Starting Zif without any
command line arguments will start the front-end menu using the built-in terminal emulator.
The games available from the menus should be stored under the Games sub-directory and
need to be listed in the file "Games/list".

The command line option --help (or -h) provides a list of all the command line options.
Supplying a Z-code game file as a command line argument will load and run the game file
directly bypassing the front-end menus.

## Recomended setup on a Kindle3

1. Install a Kindle3 Jailbreak (see https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=122519)

2. Install and configure the usbnetwork package (see https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=973688&postcount=1)

3. Make sure that remote ssh access is up and running and is available by default after a reboot

4. Really make sure that you completed step 3.

5. Install the Zif <tgz-file> to the Kindle.

```
   scp <tgz-file> root@<kindle-hostname>:/mnt/us
   ssh root@<kindle-hostname>
   cd /mnt/us
   mkdir Zif
   cd Zif
   mv ../<tgz-file> .
   gunzip <tgz-file>
   tar xvf <tar-file>
```

6. Kill the Amazon Kindle ebook framework. (It will restart when the Kindle next re-boots)

```
   ssh root@<kindle-hostname>    # if not already logged in
   killall start.sh cvm
```

NOTE: If you want to restart the kindle and get the Kindle ebook framework back

```
   shutdown -r now
```

7. Check Zif works

```
   cd /mnt/us/Zif
   ./zif --version
   ./zif
```

8. An easy way to automatically start Zif on boot up is to modify the start script
/opt/amazon/ebook/bin/start.sh. Find the "START OF SCRIPT LINE" which is around
line 225 and then add the following lines before the while loop e.g.
```
   cd /mnt/us/Zif
   ./zif
```

i.e.

```
   cd /opt/amazon/ebook/bin
   mntroot rw
   vi start.sh
   mntroot ro
   shutdown -r now
```

This will mean that Zif will start automatically on boot and on quiting Zif the normal
Amazon Kindle startup will resume.
